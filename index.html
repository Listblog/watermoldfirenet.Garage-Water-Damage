                <p>
                    Only people’s unfinished basements and attics are neglected more than their garages. Even when water damage is seen in a garage, it is often ignored and repairs are put off because it is considered a less important space then other areas of the home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem with this type of thinking is that water damage never gets better on its own. The damage only gets worse and the cost of repairs only goes up. Time is never on your side when it comes to water damage.

                    <b>What kind of Damage can Water do to my Garage?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Becuase most garages are basically "unfinished", you don't think the damage can become more severe. There is a lot of damage that water can do to your garage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Structural Damage</i> – Concrete is a porous material. That may sound silly to you, but think about it. If your car leaks oil on your garage floor it creates a stain. The stain is caused because the concrete absorbs some of the oil. If oil can soak into a concrete floor, why would you think that water cannot?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Water absorbed into a concrete garage floor can be transferred to wooden framing or the drywall on the shared walls between the garage and the living areas of your home. It can also enter the air in form of humidity, and cause damage in that way. Moisture could also travel the other way, down to your home's foundation. The expansion and contraction in your foundation caused by water can lead to cracks in the foundation, whickh can be every costly to repair. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Personal Property Damage</i> – let’s face it, our garages are not only for our cars, they are where we store things. And we don’t only store junk in the garage. That is where we store camping equipment, sporting goods, lawn equipment, and hand tools, among other items. Water can damage any of these items to the point of that they become permanently ruined beyond repair and replacement is your only option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Mold Growth</i> - anytime water affects items and is not removed and then the items dried, mold can begin to grow. Most garages are darker spaces, and for the majority of the time they are warm if not hot. Mold like wet, dark, warm areas. It is very easy for mold that begins in the garage to infiltrate the walls in your home.
                </p>
